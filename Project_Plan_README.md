# SommelierBot

1.  Tweepy - Need for someone to build FE to the sommelier bot.
- a. User '@'s Twitter bot with residual sugar, pH, alcohol % *OR* beverage name (ex. "Coors Light")
- b. TwitterBot pings API to query for wine and pairings to pass to bot *AND/OR* calculates a score based on KNN Machine Learning model
- c. TwitterBot replies with score of wine *AND/OR* recommended food pairing for wine
2.  Machine Learning
- a. Build ML bot to train/test score white & red wine (we decided to use KNN with an accuracy slightly above 50%, although our prediction model based on a TensorFlow ML model was more accurate at 80%)
- b. Use inputs from CSV  (alcohol content, sugar content, pH, red vs. white wine)
- c. Run inputs through ML to return a wine score.
- d. Pass score through to TwitterBot.

DID NOT USE
*3.  Matplotlib
- a. show breakouts/distribution of data.
- b. show things like Random Forest vs Decision Trees vs Regression vs Nearest Neighbors (etc.)
- c. discuss which we chose and why.*
DID NOT USE

4. Class participation
- a. Bring in a few (2 or 3) bottles of wine for a taste testing to let classmates guess which wine scored the highest.  Make sure they are on the API list!!!!
- b. Compare the sample wine's tech sheets to the bot's results.
- c. Discuss findings, shortcomings, etc.
- d. Drink more wine.
